### ANALYSIS QUESTIONS

""" 1.	How have Estonian government expenses on healthcare changed over time? 
        How these changes compare to EU countries' indicators? How these changes compare to Baltic countries' indicators?
    2.	How have peopleâ€™s out-of-pocket expenses on healthcare changed in Estonia? 
        How these changes compare to EU countries' indicators? How these changes compare to Baltic countries' indicators?
    3.	How have expenses in private healthcare changed in Estonia? 
        How these changes compare to EU countries' indicators? How these changes compare to Baltic countries' indicators?
    4.	Which is the best country in the EU based on healthcare indicators?"""
